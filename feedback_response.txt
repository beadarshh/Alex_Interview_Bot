Let's work on enhancing your interview presence!  Here's some feedback based on the provided image and audio:

1. Sitting Posture:

Your posture appears slightly slumped.  For a video interview, it’s important to sit up straight with your shoulders back and relaxed. This conveys confidence and professionalism. Imagine a string gently pulling you up from the crown of your head.  Good posture also helps you project your voice more effectively.

2. Speaking Quality:

 Tone: Your tone is a bit monotone and lacks enthusiasm.  Try to modulate your voice—vary your pitch and volume slightly to keep the listener engaged. A warmer, more expressive tone will make you sound more approachable and confident.
 Clarity: Your pronunciation is clear, but your pace is a little fast.  Slow down slightly; this will improve clarity and help you articulate your thoughts more effectively.
 Pace:  As mentioned, slowing down will help you present information in a more organized manner.  Pausing briefly between sentences can emphasize key points and improve comprehension.
 Confidence:  While your pronunciation is good, the slight monotone and rapid pace slightly detract from the confidence you project. By improving your tone, pace, and posture, your confidence will naturally shine through.

3. Word Choices:

Your word choice is appropriate for a brief introduction. However, consider using slightly more formal language. For example, instead of "Hello, my self is...", a more natural and professional introduction would be "Hello, my name is..."  This small change will significantly enhance your professionalism.


Overall:

You're already off to a good start!  With a few minor adjustments to your posture, pace, and tone, you'll make a much stronger impression in your interviews. Focus on those areas, and you'll find it easier to communicate your qualifications confidently and effectively. Remember, practice makes perfect!  Try recording yourself again, focusing on these improvements. You'll see a significant difference.
